# Python-Challenge-Final2
In this folder, I have two python files: PyBank and PyPoll
In PyBank, I have written a script that reads and analyzes the set of financial data. I have calculated the total number of months, the net total of profits/losses over the entire period, the average change of the profits/losses, the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits. 
In PyPoll, I have writtena script that reads and analyzes the set of poll data. I have calculated the total number of votes cast, a list of the candidates who received votes, the percentage and total of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
